                <h1>Is SnapNostr not working for you?</h1>
                <small>Checkout the following list of troubleshooting steps.</small>
            </div>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Override default Nostr relays</strong>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes, certain relays take up extra time to provide the information about Nostr notes. In such cases, you can override existing Nostr relays list in the <strong>Relays</strong> option.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Try another browser</strong>
                    <p>
                        Browsers like Opera mini, Internet explorer are not tested. So switch to tested and supported browsers like <b>Chrome</b>, <b>Firefox</b>, <b>Edge</b>, <b>Safari</b> and <b>Brave</b>.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>There is no shadow after downloading/copying image</strong>
                    <p>
                        Chances are, you might be using Safari browser. Safari has some issues with rendering shadow, or I might not know how to handle shadow in Safari. Either it's suggested to use other supported browsers for expected results.<br/>
                        If you know how to resolve this shadow problem in Safari and like to help me, I thank you in advance. Reach me out via <a href="mailto:hem@hemath.dev">hem@hemath.dev</a>
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>DP is not displayed / Image attachment in the note is not displayed</strong>
                    <p>
                        There is a possibility that your image is under a protection wall that SnapNostr wasn't able to resolve. Sometimes Safari has issues, try different browsers. You can reach me out to debug this issue.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Tried all, but no luck yet!</strong>
                    <p>
                        If you tried all the possibilities and still face issues, I'm afraid, I might not have handled an edge case.<br />
                        Please reach me out via <a href="mailto:hem@hemath.dev">hem@hemath.dev</a>. SnapNostr doesn't collect any data from you. So I can't resolve the problem without your help!
